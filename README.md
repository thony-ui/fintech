## Details

This supply chain tracking system uses NFTs to represent physical goods in the supply chain. Each NFT is unique and contains information about the good it represents, such as its origin, current location, and history of ownership. This information is stored on the Aelf blockchain, ensuring its transparency and immutability.

The frontend of the system is built with Next.js, a popular React framework that enables efficient and scalable development of web applications. The system is integrated with the Aelf blockchain API, which allows it to interact with the blockchain and manage the NFTs.
